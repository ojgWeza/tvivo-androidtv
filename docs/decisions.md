# Decisions

Short log of choices made during discovery, with rationale, so Claude Code
doesn't re-litigate them without new information.

## Kotlin (native) over Flutter

**Decision:** Build native with Kotlin, not Flutter.
**Why:** Android TV specifically benefits from native D-pad focus handling
and mature leanback/TV UI libraries. Flutter would have reused prior Kemika
experience, but the TV-specific ergonomics tipped it toward native.
**Revisit if:** the LG webOS build later needs shared logic — at that point,
re-evaluate whether a cross-platform layer is worth the cost, but don't
introduce one preemptively.

## Xtream Codes API confirmed (not flat M3U)

**Decision:** Build against the Xtream Codes `player_api.php` structured API,
not flat M3U parsing.
**Why:** Verified via `player_api.php?username=...&password=...` returning a
valid `user_info`/`server_info` JSON payload — confirmed the panel is a full
Xtream Codes install. This gives structured, separate endpoints for live/VOD/
series instead of inferring categories from `group-title` tags in a flat
M3U file.
**Evidence:** see `docs/xtream-api-reference.md` for every verified endpoint
and response shape.

## Caching: 24h TTL + manual refresh

**Decision:** Room-based local cache, 24h TTL per content type, plus a
manual refresh button that bypasses the TTL.
**Why:** Catalog data (categories, VOD/live lists) doesn't change minute to
minute, so refetching on every screen load wastes bandwidth and adds
latency. A day-long TTL balances freshness against unnecessary calls; the
manual override handles the case where the user knows new content just
dropped and doesn't want to wait.
**Not included in the TTL:** `series_episodes` — fetched lazily per show on
first open, not tied to the 24h cycle, since episode lists are cheap to
re-check per show but expensive to refresh for the entire catalog.

## Series treated as a second-pass feature

**Decision:** Build movies end-to-end first, then live (same pattern), then
series last.
**Why:** Series has an extra data layer (category → show → season/episode)
and an extra screen (season/episode picker) that don't teach anything new
architecturally once the movie slice works — it's a mechanical extension of
the same pattern, not a design risk.

## max_connections = 1 constraint

**Decision:** Documented explicitly, not solved for in the POC.
**Why:** The account only allows one active stream at a time. This matters
during testing (don't run the new app and an existing IPTV app
simultaneously) but doesn't require app-level handling beyond surfacing a
clear error if the panel rejects a connection for this reason.

# Decisions from `/plan-eng-review`, 2026-09-07

Reviewed against a live plan before any code existed. Outside voice: Codex
(`gpt-5.6-terra`). 15 findings, all folded in.

## DataStore + Tink, not EncryptedSharedPreferences

**Decision:** Encrypt credentials at rest with DataStore + Tink.
**Why:** `EncryptedSharedPreferences` was deprecated at
`security-crypto:1.1.0-alpha07`. It does synchronous crypto on the main thread
and has keyset-corruption crashes on specific OEM devices — and Android TV
boxes come overwhelmingly from those OEMs. The `CLAUDE.md` constraint was
reworded to require encryption rather than to name a library, so it cannot go
stale the same way again.
**Also required:** explicit Keystore key lifecycle, corruption recovery that
wipes and re-prompts rather than crash-loops, and exclusion from Android backup.

## Compose for TV, not Leanback

**Decision:** `androidx.tv:tv-material` for all browse UI; Media3's classic
`PlayerView` hosted in an `AndroidView` for playback.
**Why:** Leanback is deprecated with Compose for TV named as the replacement,
and `tv-material` is stable at 1.0.0. The player stays on `PlayerView` because
its D-pad transport handling has years of production use, and playback is the
one screen where a focus regression is most visible.
**Revisit if:** Media3's Compose-native player UI matures.

## Cache TTL is tracked per category, not per content type

**Decision:** `sync_meta(account_id, content_type, category_id, last_synced_at)`
with a scoped delete-then-insert inside one `@Transaction`.
**Why:** Fetches are per category (`get_vod_streams&category_id={id}`), but the
original design tracked freshness per content type and overwrote the whole
table. Refreshing one category therefore deleted every other category's rows
and then stamped them fresh for 24h — a silent, order-dependent data-loss bug
that presents as "some categories are randomly empty". TTL granularity must
match fetch granularity.

## Every cached row is scoped to an account

**Decision:** `account_id` (derived from server + port + username) on every
cached entity and sync record; atomic wipe on account change.
**Why:** The app is deliberately provider-agnostic — the server is user-entered
and may point at an entirely different panel. Without account scoping,
switching credentials surfaces the previous provider's catalog, artwork, and
resume positions with no error. Resume positions specifically need the
composite key `(account, content_type, item_id)`; `item_id` alone collides.

## Shared cache primitive, thin per-type repositories

**Decision:** One `CachedFetch` primitive owns the TTL check, the scoped
transaction, and chunked inserts. `Vod`/`Live`/`Series` repositories are thin
and only supply the API call and row mapping.
**Why:** The repeated logic — the highest-risk code, where the bug above lived
— exists exactly once. A single generic `CatalogRepository<T>` owning all three
content types was considered and rejected: live, VOD, and series diverge in
fields, playback rules, and refresh needs, so one owner accumulates
`when(contentType)` branching, which relocates duplication rather than removing
it. Share the mechanism, not the ownership.

## Cleartext permitted, TLS never weakened

**Decision:** `network_security_config.xml` permitting cleartext, system trust
anchors only, opportunistic HTTPS when `server_info` reports an `https_port`.
**Why:** `targetSdk 28+` blocks cleartext, and the panel is HTTP on a
non-standard port — without this the app cannot connect at all. The common
next mistake is disabling certificate validation when HTTPS turns out to have a
bad chain; that makes every connection forgeable, and since credentials sit in
the URL path of every request, the exposure is total.

## Defensive player instrumentation is kept, deliberately

**Decision:** Extractor flags (`FLAG_DETECT_ACCESS_UNITS`,
`FLAG_ALLOW_NON_IDR_KEYFRAMES`, `FLAG_ENABLE_CONSTANT_BITRATE_SEEKING`) plus
both a BUFFERING watchdog and an `onRenderedFirstFrame` check.
**Why:** Both relevant failures are silent rather than exception-bearing. TS
lacking AUD/IDR markers hangs in BUFFERING forever; HEVC on MediaTek SoCs
renders black video while audio continues, which a BUFFERING watchdog cannot
see. The outside voice argued this is speculative without a reproducing sample
— but physical-TV validation is deliberately deferred to Phase 5, so no such
sample will exist until the end. That is precisely when cheap instrumentation
pays for itself.

## Physical-TV validation deferred to Phase 5 (accepted risk)

**Decision:** Emulator-first throughout; the physical box is exercised once,
after Phase 5.
**Why:** The code is heavily deduplicated — one cache primitive, one URL
builder, one error mapper — so a defect found late has a single place to be
fixed. The outside voice disagreed, noting that decode and transport failures
are not code defects and gain nothing from single-site fixing.
**Accepted risk:** Phase 3's live `.ts` path carries the most exposure. The
Phase 0 `dumpsys media.codec` probe is a partial mitigation only — it reports
advertised decoders, not whether real files render.
**Revisit if:** the Phase 0 probe shows the box lacks a working HEVC decoder,
or the Phase 5 session surfaces more than one hardware-specific failure.
